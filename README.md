This app is a technical challenge, with the goal being to create a website for storing and viewing staff members' choice of prospective new furniture. 

*I choose Ruby and the Rails framework for the straight forward 
*authentication methods available using gems like Devise, and the accessibility of useful styling frameworks like Bootstrap. 

The staff members' selections are only viewable by the logged-in admin, via the edit page viewable by clicking the admin's name.
